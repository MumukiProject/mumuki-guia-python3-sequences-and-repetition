_And finally here is the main course of the lesson :spaghetti:!_

:person_walking: Of all the cool things we can do with sequences of things, probably the most powerful is to _traverse_ - or _loop_ through - **each** of their elements, using the `for` control structure:

```python
def print_each_element(elements):
  for element in elements:
    print(element)
```

This control structure will allow us to...

> ...nope, we'd better not tell you what exactly `for` does :smiling_imp:.  Find it out by trying the **procedure** `print_each_element` in the console:

> ```python
ムprint_each_element(["Violeta", "Mercedes", "Natalia", "Charo", "María Elena"])
```
>
> ```python
ムprint_each_element([True, False, False, True])
```
>
> ```python
ムprint_each_element("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
```
>
> ```python
ムprint_each_element(range(1, 10))
```
>
> ```python
ムprint_each_element(range(5, 30, 2)) # pay attention to the third argument of range
```
> When you're done, type `done()`
