🖨️ As we can see, `print` _prints_ its argument to the screen. It works with lists, strings, and... almost any type of data! And like every good procedure, it returns nothing! Or more precisely, it returns `None` 😜

On the other hand, when we are in the console the results are slightly different when we use strings. That's why it wasn't necessary... until now.
