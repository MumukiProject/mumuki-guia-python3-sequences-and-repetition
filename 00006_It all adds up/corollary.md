Good! :clap: Although the `product` function does not exist in Python, there is a `sum` function that calculates a summation as we did here.

What these two functions have in common - and almost all the ones we'll see next - is that they are based on the structure of an _accumulator_: a local variable that we **initialize with a base value**, and whenever we visit a element, we will **update it**. And in the end, **we will return that accumulated result**.
