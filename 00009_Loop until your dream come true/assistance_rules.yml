  then: 'don''t forget to replace the `???` with code that actually does something

    these_expectations_failed:
    - todos_los_dias_un_poco Not:UsesOr
  then: in the previous example we had to check whether **any** duration met a condition
    and we used `or`, but here we have to check that **all** durations meet it - is
    there another logical operator that solves this problem for us?
- !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess
  when: !ruby/hash:ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess
    only_these_expectations_failed:
    - todos_los_dias_un_poco Not:Assigns:WithFalse
  then: you probably want to initialize your accumulator with another value
