We were about to suggest playing a well-known game about finding a character in a red and white sweater, but due to copyright issues we're going to do a low-budget version :copyright:: _Where are the keys?_

> Using what we've learned in this lesson, define the function `where_are_the_keys` that takes a string with emojis and tells us what position the keys are in, counting from `1`:
>
> ```python
> ムwhere_are_the_keys("🌂🐍🔑👛")
> 3
> ムwhere_are_the_keys("🔑🔥👓")
> 1
> ムwhere_are_the_keys("🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🔑🧉")
> 8
> ```
>
> Let 's assume that the keys are _always_ there.
