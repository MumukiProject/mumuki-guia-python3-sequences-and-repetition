In this lesson you learned something very important: how to make the computer repeat tasks, using the `for` control structure.

You also learned about _slices_, which allow us to extract segments from lists and strings, and about ranges, which let us generate integer sequences between two others. And we've combined all these concepts with the power of lists, to group items and make repetitive tasks easier to do.

This cauldron of knowledge already contains all the ingredients for the programming potion... :woman_mage::man_mage:

...but not so fast, there is still one ingredient missing! :crystal_ball: In the next lesson we'll reveal the mystery of _the dictionaries_.
